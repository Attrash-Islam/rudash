# This module was written in order to give the predicate functions for R_.filter, R_.map, R_.each, etc..
# to be called with any dynamic arguments as it can. What differante JavaScript from Ruby is that once you configured a function
# with a specific set of arguments then you must call it with that set or else you will get an exception.
# That is so useful for predicate functions that developer define out of the library scope. We send all the arguments
# to the developer defined Proc and if it's failed because of ArgumentError we call it recursively with less argument until success.
